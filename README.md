## Introduction ##

Mailpile (<https://www.mailpile.is/>) is a modern, fast web-mail client with
user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of Mailpile
is funded by [a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)
and all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI
approved Free Software license.

Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user interface
and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to make it easy
and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed e-mail.

Mailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic
command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology for
the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop
application (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a remote
web-mail on a personal server or VPS.

The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal
with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine
allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and
the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail
either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.

**Note:** We are currently at an early alpha state of development, so if you
just want a useful tool and aren't interested in hacking on the code, you
should probably check back later or [follow @MailpileTeam on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/MailpileTeam) and watch for updates.


### Trying Mailpile

We have live demos up and running [on our
website](https://www.mailpile.is/demos/). If you are curious about what
Mailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out.


### Installing Mailpile

Note that Mailpile is still in early development and is not suitable
for production or end-user use. However, developers are encouraged to
give it a try and even help us find bugs, fix them and develop new
features.

Please see [the wiki for
details](https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/wiki/Getting-started).

it's neat, you should also check out PageKite: <https://pagekite.net/>

The GMail guys get mad props for creating the best webmail service out
there.  Wishing the Free Software world had something like it is what
inspired me to start working on this.
