In order for this to work, you need to add three things here:

  - a folder called GnuPG, containing a standalone Windows build of GnuPG >= 2.0.25.
  - a folder called OpenSSL, containing a standalone Windows build of OpenSSL >= 1.0.1h.
  - a folder called Python27, containing a standalone Windows build of Python >= 2.7.6.

On top of that, you need to install NSIS (Nullsoft Installer System).

Then just run "make".
